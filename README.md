# Movielingo

Movielingo is a webapp built during my time as an Insight Data Science Fellow. It helps second language learners of English and ESL instructors find movies and TV-shows appropriate for a given English proficiency level.

Movielingo uses two corpora of second language learners' texts labelled for English proficiency. NLP features are extracted from these texts, and a machine learning pipeline is built predicting continuous English proficience scores based exclusively on text characteristics.

The ML model is then used to predict the language proficiency in a movie / TV-show using a subtitle corpus.
